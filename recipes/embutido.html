             <ol>

                <li>Mix everything together using your hand to make sure that all is well incorporated. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Cut 2 pieces of aluminum foil about 12 inches long each. Take half of the meat mixture and flatten it on of the foil, covering about a half. Don't forget to leave some space at the ends, about 2 inches each side.</li>
                <li>Place the sausages and hard boiled eggs on the middle of the flattened meat.</li>
                <li>Roll the foil so that the meat forms a cylinder or log, locking the sausage and egg in the center. Twist the ends of the foil to lock.</li>
                <li>Steam for 50-60 minutes.</li>
